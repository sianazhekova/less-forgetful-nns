"""Runs a single experiment to demonstrate catastrophic forgetting in 
neural networks, and Elastic Weight Consolidation to overcome it.
The results are recorded in .csv files so they can be plotted later.

You have the choice of three modes:

1. Simple
    This mode sequentially trains the network on different datasets
    of equal complexity.
    The network will "forget" what it learned about the first datasets 
    as it learns more.
2. Mixed
    This mode trains the network on different datasets that have
    been shuffled together before training.
    The network learns all datasets, but we have to have all of
    the data at the start.
3. EWC
    This mode sequentially trains the networks on different datasets,
    using Elastic Weight Consolidation to prevent the network from
    forgetting so much about previously learned data.
4. L2
    Like EWC, but not including the Fisher information, just a
    uniformly weighted quadratic penalty for moving away from the
    old mode.
    
The datasets are permutations of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
